how to process http-request on server-side ?


 ==> based on URL
 ==> based HTTP-method
      GET    ==> read resource
      HEAD   ==> read resource details like size,modifued-date,.. not resource
      POST   ==> create new resourse e.g create new todo
      PUT    ==> create / update resourse
      PATCH  ==> partial update on resourse
      DELETE ==> delete resourse
      OPTION ==> return user privileges on resource

==> based on request-header(s)
     => meta-data about request & response to client/server
==> based on locale
==> based on authentication
==> based input parameters
